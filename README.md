# Sample code for Concepts of Programming Languages
This repository serves for illustrating different programming techniques that can be used to solve the following problems:
* Multiple Views Program
* Distributed Constraint Enforcement

The first problem is solved with the use of:
* Aspect-Oriented programming (AspectJ) [Example](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Langstra/copl/master/multiple_views/aop/index.html)
* Dynamic programming [Example](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Langstra/copl/master/multiple_views/dynamic/index.html)

The second problem is solved with the use of:
* Dynamic programming [Example](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Langstra/copl/master/constraints/dynamic/index.html)
* Event-driven programming [Example](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Langstra/copl/master/constraints/event-driven/index.html)
